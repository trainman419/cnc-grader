   <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>

   <h3>Languages</h3>

   <p>Programs may be submitted in a number of languages. The grader is currently capable of dealing with C, C++, Java, Python, Perl, Ruby, and Frink. Haskell support should work, but is untested because I don't have a reference implementation of the test problem in Haskell. Other scripting languages may also work, if you include the appropriate #! at the beginning of your file.</p>
   <p>If you are interested in support for another language, please write a solution to the "Ones" problem in that language and submit it for compatibility testing.</p>

   <h3>Input and Output</h3>

   <p>All programs should read input on standard input, and produce output on standard output. Your program will be run with its input and output redirected to files, and diff will be used to compare your output with the correct answer.</p>

   <p>A simple program that does this in C would be:</p>

   <pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
   int i;
   while( scanf("%d", &amp;i) ) {
      printf("%d\n", i);
   }
   return 0;
}
   </pre>

   <p>This would then be compiled by the grader:</p>

   <pre>cc sample.c</pre>

   <p>And run with sample inputs (in1.txt) and outputs (out1.txt)</p>

   <p>in1.txt:</p>
   <pre>
1
2
3
   </pre>

   <p>out1.txt:</p>
   <pre>
1
2
3
   </pre>

   <p>Invocation:</p>
   <pre>./a.out &lt; in1.txt | diff -wBb - out1.txt</pre>

   <p>The return code from diff is then used to determine if your program has passed or failed.</p>
